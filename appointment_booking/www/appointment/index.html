                                                        I started offering marketing consulting services
                                                        in 2008. Here is my short story.</p>
                                                    <p>I sold every service I knew how to deliver. I
                                                        sold web design, video marketing, launch
                                                        services, email campaigns, landing page
                                                        creation, content writing, conversion services,
                                                        and more. I was so overwhelmed I would often get
                                                        confused on which scope of work belonged to a

                                                        disposal. I used cold email, cold calling,
                                                        proposals, free consults, networking, referrals,

                                                        Nothing. The grind left me overwhelmed,
                                                        exhausted, confused, and depressed. My business
                                                        began to shrink and my family began to complain.
                                                        I was failing both at the same time. Something

                                                        wrong. Most people are chasing mystical,
                                                        “hockey-stick explosion” growth. This is
                                                        exciting to read about in an entrepreneurship
                                                        magazine, but it’s an unpractical pursuit for
                                                        the everyday consulting business.</p>
                                                    <p>To be a bit more grounded, let’s stop and define
                                                        “scale”. Miriam-Webster defines scale as
                                                        "capable of being easily expanded or upgraded on
                                                        demand". So what we really mean is...</p>
                                                    <h3>“Scale” equals “control”.</h3>
                                                    <p>If you can expand something easily you have
                                                        control over it. If you can upgrade something on
                                                        demand you have control over it. So really,
                                                        “scale” means you have control over how fast

                                                    <p>This begins to explain why the conventional
                                                        wisdom on how to scale hasn’t worked for you. At

                                                        issues, and costs. You never scale. You never

                                                        like you have more or less control?</p>
                                                    <p>The ugly truth is: doing more costs more. It cost
                                                        more of your time, energy, and money as you
                                                        understand, execute, and manage an increasing
                                                        number of moving parts.</p>
                                                    <p>The only way to get the control (and scale) you
                                                        want is by thinking about your business another
                                                        way.</p>
                                                    <h3>It’s safer (and smarter) to do less.</h3>
                                                    <p>What is a safer, smarter way to scale? Do fewer
                                                        things. Why?</p>
                                                    <p>It’s easier to control. There is less to
                                                        manage.<br>
                                                        It’s easier to create predictability. There are
                                                        fewer surprises.<br>
                                                        It’s easier to establish a standard of
                                                        excellence. You can get better each time.</p>
